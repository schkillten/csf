Description of files

new_bounce.py --- Two balls starting on the far left side and far right side
 with a box surrounding them, they bounce from one side to the other, then back,
 to their original position randomly changing colors on impact with the floor
 
test_fact.py --- testing the factory.py mod just me trying to make things easier when
 making the objects, didnt help much though, but the test_fact.py generates random
 balls of random sizes and in random coordinates (not very clear in the program)
 of random colors using the make_color function with their pre defined colors #Note
 you can also use the RGB value of colors instead of their predefined colors I was just
 lazy.

all the other files are just random files of me either trying to test something out
or to implement an idea and failing
due to a lack of experience with Vpython, first time using it.

And its all very ugly code and not easy to manipulate
