Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963


Problem 3:

The first issue when commenting out the two sections of code causes a not defined error since the variable "linenum" is being used before its defined "linenum = <linenum> + 1" being used as if has a value.
If you were to comment out "gc_count = 0" in this case you would get the same result since again, you are trying to use a variable that has no value, that is not assigned anything and add it to an int.

Problem 4:

GC-Content: 0.43029262963
AT-Content: 0.568993851852



Collaboration:

No one

Reflection:

Learned how useful it is to be able to read other source codes so they can be modified for other uses.
