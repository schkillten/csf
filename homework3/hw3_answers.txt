Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963


Problem 3:

The first issue when commenting out the two sections of code causes a not defined error since the variable "linenum" is being used before its defined "linenum = <linenum> + 1" being used as if has a value.
If you were to comment out "gc_count = 0" in this case you would get the same result since again, you are trying to use a variable that has no value, that is not assigned anything and add it to an int.

Problem 4:

GC-Content: 0.3
AT-Content: 0.7



Collaboration:

No one :(

Reflection:

Well this assignment reinforced the idea of how powerful being able to read other source codes can be and the simplicity it brings to making modifications for your own use. My suggestion to future students, well i wouldn't recommend making a habbit of this but, you may not always need to understand what the soul purpose of the code is, such as a dna analysis or what the nucleotides are, because in this case for problem 4 it was simply asking to do the same thing for AT content as GC content, if you understand how it is getting the output for the GC content then you just modify it for AT content, in the end it is the same code searching for different results. I have zero experience with DNA analysis (not that I am not open to learning it) but i did not need to know anything about it to complete this assignment.
