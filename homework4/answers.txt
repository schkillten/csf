Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.



Problem 5:

Total G-Count: 5738773
Total C-Count: 5879128
Total A-Count: 7701287
Total T-Count: 7661547

Problem 6:

The total in each test-high-1/2 and test-moderate-1/2 the total sum of at/gc is always different from the total count and seq length, since in these files there exists a character "N", the "N" is counted in the total count and the length sums since it is apart of whats being read but it is not apart of any of our if statements searching for only A T G or C. The sum of ATGC is only searching for those 4 characters not anything else.




Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 1.32234161747


Problem 8:

GC Classification: Moderate

Collaboration:

No one :(
