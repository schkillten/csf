Problem 3 (What is Assert doing?)
In your homework file, define a = 5 and b = 5.
Then add “assert a == b”

What is the code giving you?

Now change b = 10

What is the code giving you?

What exactly is assert verifying in this step?

Problem 4 (Defining a function and calling a function)
Add C = 2 to the list of variables to problem 1.
Create a function that gives the sum of “X” and “Y” then divided it by Z

Call the function by

print dv(a, b, c) to give the result of (a*b)/c




Problem 5 (What is the differences of Tuples, Lists, Dictionaries)

Create a Tuples list with 4 child name
reminder: tuples uses ()
Notes:
* Tuples are not immutable therefore you cannot change the values once its set.
Create a Lists with 4 child ages

Notes:
reminder: list uses []
to add to a list we use .append(‘value’) to add to a list
to delete a list we use: del name[index]
Create a Dictionary list with mother phone number
Notes:
reminder: dictionary use {}
to add to dictionary we use name[‘associate’] = value
to delete we use: del name[‘associate’]


Problem 6 (Creating nested list and accessing lists)
Create list_a and list_b with even same amount of variables in there. Make a new list_c with the sum of list_a and list_b indexes.


Problem 7 (for loop)
A for loop iterates over the items of any list or string in the order they appear in the sequence but you cannot directly specify
the number of iterations to make, a halting condition, or the size of the iteration step.


for example
for variable in 'first':
    print 'Current Letter:'
    
it will look like this
Current Letter : f
Current Letter : i
Current Letter : r
Current Letter : s
Current Letter : t

With the list ['apple', 'orange', 'pear'] print the current fruit.
